# T20 Cricket Score Prediction Model

### Overview
#
This project builds an IPL score prediction model using various machine learning techniques. The model predicts the total score of a team based on match conditions like overs, wickets, and runs. It utilizes popular regression algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and more. The dataset used for training contains IPL match data, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to better understand the features.
